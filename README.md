üìå Custom Object Detection using YOLOv5

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of custom object detection using YOLOv5. Unlike generic pre-trained models, this project focuses on training YOLOv5 on custom datasets, evaluating performance with multiple metrics, and deploying it for real-time applications.
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, beginner-friendly, and deployable pipeline for object detection tasks, useful for research, industry, and real-world applications.

üîç What is YOLOv5?

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is one of the most popular object detection algorithms, known for real-time detection speed and high accuracy.
YOLOv5, developed by Ultralytics, improves on earlier versions by offering:
-Faster training & inference
-Easy customization for new datasets
-Scalable models (small, medium, large variants)
-PyTorch-based flexible implementation

In this project, YOLOv5 is trained on custom datasets instead of standard COCO, enabling domain-specific detection (e.g., masks, helmets, traffic signs, tools, etc.).
